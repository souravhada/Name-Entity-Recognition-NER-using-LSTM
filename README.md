## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of identifying and classifying named entities in text. We employ the CoNLL 2003 dataset, which is a standard benchmark for NER tasks, and use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network implemented with TensorFlow.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python and the necessary Python packages installed on your system. The required packages can be installed via pip:
